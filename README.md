## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce241316-tcpwm-quaddec-rotary-mode](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce241316-tcpwm-quaddec-rotary-mode)" application with the desired name "Rotary" configured for the *KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE --app-id mtb-example-ce241316-tcpwm-quaddec-rotary-mode -alarm --user-app-name Rotary --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. TCPWM quadrature decoder is connected to GPIO with jumpers. Connect P2[1] to P14[3] and P2[0] to P0[3]

   **Figure 1. Pin connection on KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE kit**

   ![](images/litekit-setting.png)
   
   Lite Kit          | GPIO 1    | QuadDec 1 | QuadDec 2 |  GPIO 2 |           
   :--------         | :-----    | :-----    | :-----    | :-----  |
   KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE  | P14[3] (J14.7)  | P2[1] (J14.6) | P2[0] (J14.5) | P0[3] (J14.4) |
   KIT_T2G-B-E_LITE  | P14[3] (J14.7)  | P2[1] (J14.6) | P2[0] (J14.5) | P0[3] (J14.4) |


3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Press **D** key to decrease the rotary counter. Press **I** key to increase the rotary counter. Observe the results in the terminal window

## Design and implementation

This code example shows how to use an up/down rotary counter in a TCPWM quadrature decoder. The waveforms for the quadrature decoder is generated by GPIO. They are connected to the quadrature decoder inputs with jumpers. The initial value for the up/down rotary counter is 0x8000 and the initial counter is increment. After the quadrature decoder is started, when the **D** key is pressed, the counter is decrement. Also, when the **I** key is pressed, the counter is increment. And when the counter reaches 0xa000, an interrupt occurs and it is changed from increment to decrement automatically. Also, when the counter reaches 0x6000, an interrupt occurs and it is changed from decrement to increment automatically.
